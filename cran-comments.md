## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Started the Description with "Provides..." and wrote the actual period "from 2006 to 2019".
- Removed all functions from the export/NAMESPACE.
- Ensured that all functions (even though none of them are exported) do not write by default.

## Test environments
* local Debian 9.5 install, R 3.5.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
